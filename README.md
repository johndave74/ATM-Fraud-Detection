# ATM-Fraud-Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in Automated Teller Machine (ATM) operations. Leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, it aims to identify patterns and anomalies that signify potential fraud, thereby helping financial institutions to mitigate risks and protect customers


## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing transaction patterns to uncover suspicious activities.
Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting to predict fraud.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Integrating the model into a real-time monitoring system using tools like Flask or FastAPI.
Dashboard: Visualizing key metrics and fraud detection results with interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to ATM transactions, such as:

Transaction ID
Account Number
Transaction Amount
Transaction Date and Time
Location
ATM ID
Customer Information
Fraud Label: Indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
